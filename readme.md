## BlobFeatureTypes3D
Extracting and visualizing common blobs features on a height map.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage, either with a 3D
visualization or a 2D visualization.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this sample a device with AppEngine >= V2.5.0 and the relevant algorithms
is necessary. For example TriSpectorP with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
